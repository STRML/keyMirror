KeyMirror
=========

Create an object with values equal to its key names.

I thought `react/lib/keyMirror` was useful and wanted to reuse it without any dependencies.

This is not my code, this is property of Facebook.

Why?
----

From [this discussion](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/1639#issuecomment-45188026):


> The main purpose of keyMirror is to deal with the fact that Closure Compiler advanced mode crushes keys, which allows you to write code like

> `keyMirror({monkey: null, gorilla: null})`

> and have it become something like

> `k({m:null,g:null})`

> which evaluates to

> `{m:"m",g:"g"}`

> at runtime. If it was specified as a list of strings, they wouldn't get crushed matching the property names.

Usage
-----

`npm install keymirror`

```javascript
var keyMirror = require('keymirror');
var COLORS = keyMirror({blue: null, red: null});
var myColor = COLORS.blue;
var isColorValid = !!COLORS[myColor];
```

The last line could not be performed if the values of the generated enum were
not equal to their keys.

Input:  `{key1: val1, key2: val2}`

Output: `{key1: key1, key2: key2}`

You can specify the prefix for all values:

```javascript
keyMirror({
  OPEN: null,
  CLOSE: null
}, 'WINDOW_');
```

I sometimes use this with lodash - use the following upon your first use of lodash to mix it in:

```javascript
var _ = require('lodash');
_.mixin({keyMirror: require('keymirror')});
// Can now be used as _.keyMirror(object)
```
